# Punch - The Simple CLI timekeeper
__A dead simple punch card program to keep track of your time. Implemented in [Go](https://golang.org).__

## Usage
```
Usage:
  punch (-h | -v)
  punch (in|out|log) [<project_name>]
  punch list
Examples:
  punch in
  punch in "ACME Website Development"
  punch out "ACME Website Development"
  punch log "ACME Website Development"
Options:
  -h, --help
  -v, --version
```

## Installation
Installing punch can be done in a few ways. Probably the simplest way is as follows (for Unix-like systems):

```
git clone https://github.com/propheis/punch.git
cd punch
go build
sudo cp punch /usr/local/bin
cd ../
rm -r punch
```

If you already have Go installed and set up [on your path](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) it is as 
simple as running

```
go get github.com/propheis/punch
```

## How it Works
When you first run Punch it will create a folder at `~/.punch` where `~` evaluates to your `$HOME` directory on 
Unix-like systems and usually `C:\Users\YourName\` on Windows. Anytime you `punch in` or `punch out` it will 
write to `~/.punch/default.punch`. If you do something like `punch in "test"` it will write to 
`~/.punch/test.punch`. This is how punch keeps track of your various projects. These files are referred to as 
punchCards.

The punchCards contain the logs for each of your projects in an easy to parse format. Rows are separated by a 
newline character (`\n`) and columns by a tab character (`\t`). This makes it easy to process the data in other
programs or generate reports.

If you are using a Unix-like OS (Linux, BSD, MacOS, etc.) you can do cool stuff as well like piping the output
of Punch to other programs. For example, to find the list of all the times you punched out of a project called
"test" and save it to a file called `times.txt`, you could run the following command:

```
punch log test | grep "OUT" | awk '{print $3, $4, $5, $6, $8}' > times.txt
```
